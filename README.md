# Welcome to form-my-form! 

Every time when starting a new project I end up by realizing how much work it takes to create forms.

This time I got tired and decided to create this package, so that I can easily use it in multiple projects - so can you :)

It's still in v0.1.7 so there's still some stuff to cover. So... Coming in the next days:

- Docs
- Improvement in error handling

... And next:

- Typescript
- Colors customisation

Hope you like it!
